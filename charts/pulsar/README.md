## Environment setup

Before proceeding to deploying Pulsar, you need to prepare your environment.

### Tools

- Install `helm` on your computer. For details, see [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
- Install `kubectl` on your computer. For details, see [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

## Add Apache Pulsar Chart to local Helm repository

To add this chart to your local Helm repository, execute this command.

```bash
helm repo add streamnative https://charts.streamnative.io
```

## Prepare Kubernetes clusters

To use this chart, you need a Kubernetes cluster whose version is 1.14 or higher, due to the usage of certain Kubernetes features.

We provide some instructions to guide you through the preparation for the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](../../docs/pulsar/install/gke.md).

## Deploy Pulsar to Kubernetes

1. Clone this repository and switch to the target directory.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/streamnative/charts.git
    cd charts
    ```

2. Run `prepare_helm_release.sh` to create required Kubernetes resources for installing this Helm chart.

    - A Kubernetes namespace for installing the Pulsar release (if `-c` is specified)
    - Create the JWT secret keys and tokens for three superusers: `broker-admin`, `proxy-admin`, and `admin`.
      By default, it generates the asymmetric pubic/private key pair. You can choose to generate symmetric secret key by specifying `--symmetric` in the following command.
        - `proxy-admin` role is used for proxies to communicate to brokers.
        - `broker-admin` role is used for inter-broker communications.
        - `admin` role is used by the admin tools.

    ```bash
    ./scripts/pulsar/prepare_helm_release.sh -n <k8s-namespace> -k <pulsar-release-name> -c
    ```

3. Add Loki Helm Charts repository and update charts.

    ```bash
    helm repo add loki https://grafana.github.io/loki/charts
    helm dependency update charts/pulsar
    ```

4. Use the Pulsar Helm charts to install Apache Pulsar. 

    > **Note**  
    > Please specify `--set initialize=true` when installing a release at the first time. `initialize=true` will start initialize jobs to initialize the cluster metadata for both BookKeeper and Pulsar clusters.

    ```bash
    helm install --set initialize=true <pulsar-release-name> streamnative/pulsar
    ```

5. Access the Pulsar cluster.

    The default values will create a `ClusterIP` for the proxy that you can use to interact with the cluster. To find the IP address of proxy use:

    ```bash
    kubectl get service -n <k8s-namespace>
    ```

## Customize the deployment 

We provide a [detailed guideline](../../docs/pulsar/install/deployment.md) for you to customize the Helm Chart for a production-ready deployment.

You can also checkout out the example values file for different deployments.

- [Deploy ZooKeeper only](examples/pulsar/values-cs.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster with an external configuration store](../../examples/pulsar/values-cs.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster with local persistent volume](../../examples/pulsar/values-local-pv.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster to Minikube](../../examples/pulsar/values-minikube.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster with no persistence](../../examples/pulsar/values-no-persistence.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster with TLS encryption](../../examples/pulsar/values-tls.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster with JWT authentication using symmetric key](../../examples/pulsar/values-jwt-symmetric.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster with JWT authentication using asymmetric key](../../examples/pulsar/values-jwt-asymmetric.yaml)
- [Deploy a Pulsar cluster with KoP, Istio, and TLS encryption](../../examples/pulsar/values-kop-tls-istio.yaml)

## Deploy Function Worker

To deploy function worker service, we can update the value.yaml to enable function worker by
```yaml
components:
  # functions
  functions: true
```
Then upgrade the chart
```
helm upgrade -f /path/to/pulsar/value/file.yaml $RELEASE_NAME $PULSAR_CHART
```

Function worker can also be deployed as separate Kubernetes Statefulset for stability and process power.
Enabling it by:
```yaml
functions:
  useDedicatedRunner: true
```
Then upgrade the chart
```
helm upgrade -f /path/to/pulsar/value/file.yaml $RELEASE_NAME $PULSAR_CHART
```

When migrating function worker from run with broker mode to standalone mode, if using **KubernetesRuntimeFactory** then functions will be spin up as independent Statefulset
and you don't need to worry about the upgrade interrupting the running function. If using **ThreadRuntimeFactory** or **ProcessRuntimeFactory**
then the function should resume working once the function worker is up and running.

For authentication, if enabled authentication and vault function worker will mount the same token broker use to do intra broker communication.
For authorization, it'll have the same permission granted to broker super user role.

After running function worker in standalone mode, admin operation related to function should add --admin-url <address to pulsar proxy>
as proxy knows how to redirect the request to function worker.

## Upgrading

Once your Pulsar Chart is installed, configuration changes and chart updates should be done using the `helm upgrade` command.

If you are updating images used by the Pulsar Chart, you can specify `imagePuller.hook.enabled` to enable a Helm hook to pull images before
deploying a newer Helm release. The `imagePuller` ensures all the images are pulled to all Kubernetes hosts before deploying the Helm release.

```bash
helm repo add streamnative https://charts.streamnative.io/
helm repo update
helm get values <pulsar-release-name> > pulsar.yaml
helm upgrade -f pulsar.yaml \
    [--set imagePuller.hook.enabled=true] \
    <pulsar-release-name> streamnative/pulsar
```

## Uninstall Pulsar Chart

To uninstall the Pulsar Chart, execute the following command.

```bash
helm uninstall <pulsar-release-name>
```

For the purposes of continuity, these charts have some Kubernetes objects that are not removed when performing `helm uninstall`.
These items we require you to *conciously* remove them, as they affect re-deployment should you choose to.

* PVCs for stateful data, which you must *consciously* remove
    - ZooKeeper: This is your metadata.
    - BookKeeper: This is your data.
    - Prometheus: This is your metrics data, which can be safely removed.
* Secrets, if generated by our [prepare release script](https://github.com/streamnative/charts/blob/master/scripts/pulsar/prepare_helm_release.sh). They contain secret keys, tokens, etc. You can use [cleanup release script](https://github.com/streamnative/charts/blob/master/scripts/pulsar/cleanup_helm_release.sh) to remove these secrets and tokens as needed.

## Migration

If you want to migrate from [apache/pulsar-helm-chart](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-helm-chart) to the streamantive/charts,
you can use the [values-migrate.yaml](../../examples/pulsar/values-migrate.yaml) to upgrade your cluster for migrating to the streamnative/charts.

```bash
helm upgrade --set namespace=<cluster-namespace> --set initialize=false --values example/pulsar/values-migrate.yaml <pulsar-release-name> streamnative/pulsar --version <streamnative/pulsar-chart-version>
```
