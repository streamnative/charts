# What is StreamNative Platform

StreamNative Platform is a cloud-native messaging and event-streaming platform that enables you to build a real-time application and data infrastructure for both real-time and historical events. Founded by the original developers of [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) and [Apache BookKeeper](https://bookkeeper.apache.org/), [StreamNative](https://streamnative.io/) offers a complete, self-managed platform for continuously streaming data across your organization to power rich customer experiences and data-driven operations. You can deploy StreamNative Platform on-premise or in-cloud.

Powered by Apache Pulsar, StreamNative Platform makes it easy to build mission-critical messaging and streaming applications and real-time data pipelines by integrating data from multiple sources into a single, central messaging and event streaming platform for your company. StreamNative Platform lets you focus on how to maximize business value from real-time data rather than worrying about the underlying mechanisms such as how data is messaged between various systems and how data is stored reliably for processing.

Specifically, StreamNative Platform simplifies:

- Publishing-and-consuming messages using popular messaging protocols (including Apache Pulsar and Apache Kafka)
- Connecting various data sources to Pulsar
- Building real-time applications with Pulsar
- Integrating your data processing infrastructure with Pulsar
- Securing, monitoring, and managing your Pulsar deployments

Most importantly, StreamNative Platform enables you to:

- Deploy and manage Pulsar in your private cloud environment.
- Deploy and manage your platform as a cloud-native system on Kubernetes.
- Monitor the health and performance of Pulsar clusters using dedicated tools such as Pulsar detector and StreamNative Console.
